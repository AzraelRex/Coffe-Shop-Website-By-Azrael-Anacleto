This is the coffee shop web app that I made using HTML and CSS.
It is named Coffeegang, as I have this thing where my personal branding uses words like Goat and Gang. Because I am the undisputed goat, hopefully I will be someday in 
software development as well.
This is potentially a portfolio project.
Though I will be improving it more in the future.
I will host this on both Netlify and Vercel for the world to see.
